Oh, hello. Yes. I just told me I was a long wait, so I was prepared to sit there for a while. Yes. My name is Janice Gerard, and I am a private citizen at home. I have about 10 boxes, you know, file boxes that need to be shredded. Okay. Okay. Whats the code that youre needing serviced in? Sorry. I didnt mean to cut you off there. Oh, its all right. 01921. 0921. Let me take a look here. So for that amount, its definitely considered bulk shredding, so thats where a truck would come to you directly. I can take a look to see what weve got in your area. And do you have any electronics that need destruction as well, like hard drives, laptops, cell phones, tablets, or is it just paper? Right now. No, just paper. Okay. Not a problem. All right. Oh, perfect. And did you fill out a form online as well? Yes, I did. And then I keep getting the same thing back, please call, you know, and whatever. Were playing phone tag with you. Yeah. So I thought Id call back. Okay. Let me pull that form up here. Okay. Ready? Excuse me. Now, when you say those things, like, do you mean like... Even an old television or old iPads or things like that? Keypads? Tablets, if theres over two. But not like a TV or anything. Okay. All right. Lets stick to... Okay. Gotcha. All right. So it looks like I do have two trucks that could do the service for you. Yeah. If youre interested in receiving a quote here. What I would do is just confirm the point of contact info you would put in with us online. Make sure we have everything correct. And then get that sent to the pricing team. Then they would each call you with a quote. And you can go with whatever works best for your budget and your schedule. Okay. No. I already filled out that thing. And then I didnt know... It says fill out with the boxes. I think I... I dont know what I did. Im sorry. Im not very good at this. Okay. Okay. Could you tell me... Let me see what I... Ive already... As I said to you, Ive already sent something out. I have 10 boxes, which are the file cabinets. Ive taken a lot of it out of the boxes, but thats what I emptied into bags. Okay. Okay. And I dont... What else do you want me to do? So are they in the boxes now? Are they currently in bags? No, theyre in bags at this point, or halves in bag boxes. And then somebody said to me, why dont you find out? Theres no way. This is heavier than I ever thought. You know, Im 82 years old. I mean, I just want to... Im trying to get rid of everything from house building from 10 years ago. And, you know, financial advisor information. So I started doing it. And somebody said, call and see if youre going to get it shredded. So its half and half, but I will put it all into bags. Whatever is more convenient for you. Just so I know, like, I have an accurate count of what youre working with. How many boxes are there and how many bags? Just so we get you an accurate quote. Well, at this point, it would be all bags, but I have emptied out 10 boxes. Okay. Gotcha. So 10 boxes worth are in bags currently. Right. Okay. Perfect. Well, yeah, then we should be all set. Weve got your first and last here, Janice. And this is the best callback number for you? Yes. Okay. Perfect. And your email is JaniceGerard179 at gmail.com? Yes. Okay. Perfect.

And theyll be calling you as soon as they are available to let you know what they would charge for that service and what their availability looks like. Okay. Can you give me a general idea what this is? Is it going to be hundreds of dollars or just general? I wont hold you to anything. Unfortunately, Im not on the pricing teams, and we do nationwide services. So I wouldnt really have a good reference on what that costs. I dont get any of that info on my end. But its a no-obligation quote. Its just letting you know what that service would cost for you. All right. So Im aware youve got my number, my information, and you will be sending me somebody that will call me and do this for me. Yes. Absolutely. Okay. Thank you. Youre very welcome.

How can I help? Yes, hi. I wanted to see, to get a quote for some shredding up for papers I have. Yeah, how many boxes of paper are you trying to shred? I dont have boxes. I have about six large black garbage bags. Okay, and the zip code where they would be? 08535. So for the amount that you have, we offer a truck service that goes to you and shreds. What I could do is gather some contact information and have the shredders call you back with pricing and available dates, if thats okay. My brother just said forget it.

How can I help? Hi, I was just calling to find out a general price for shredding. I have a few, like, file boxes that were my dads and he passed away, so I just need to have the information shredded. Yeah, absolutely. Roughly how many boxes of paper would you need to shred? I think there is five file boxes, two that are a little bit longer and three that are a little shorter. So two large boxes and three regular? Whats the zip code where everything would be? 28304. So for the amount that you have, we offer a truck service that can go to you and shred. It looks like this shredder can go out for $155. That would cover up to 270 pounds worth of paper to be shred for that price. Oh, wow. No, this is probably not even that weight. So, all right, I didnt realize it would be that much. I thought it would have been significantly less. Is there an option of, like, is it cheaper if it would be brought in? At the UPS, sir, they can charge you per pound over there to do so. Would you like me to transfer you over there for rates and procedures before you go? Sure. Absolutely.
