My name is Janice Gerard, and I am a private citizen at home. I have about 10 boxes, you know, file boxes that need to be shredded. Okay. Okay. Whats the code that youre needing serviced in? Sorry. I didnt mean to cut you off there. Oh, its all right. 01921. 0921. Let me take a look here. So for that amount, its definitely considered bulk shredding, so thats where a truck would come to you directly. I can take a look to see what weve got in your area. And do you have any electronics that need destruction as well, like hard drives, laptops, cell phones, tablets, or is it just paper? Right now. No, just paper. Okay. Not a problem. All right. Oh, perfect. And did you fill out a form online as well? Yes, I did. And then I keep getting the same thing back, please call, you know, and whatever. Were playing phone tag with you. Yeah. So I thought Id call back. Okay. Let me pull that form up here. Okay. Ready? Excuse me. Now, when you say those things, like, do you mean like... Even an old television or old iPads or things like that? Keypads? Tablets, if theres over two. But not like a TV or anything. Okay. All right. Lets stick to... Okay. Gotcha. All right. So it looks like I do have two trucks that could do the service for you. Yeah. If youre interested in receiving a quote here. What I would do is just confirm the point of contact info you would put in with us online. Make sure we have everything correct. And then get that sent to the pricing team. Then they would each call you with a quote. And you can go with whatever works best for your budget and your schedule. Okay. No. I already filled out that thing. And then I didnt know... It says fill out with the boxes. I think I... I dont know what I did. Im sorry. Im not very good at this. Okay. Okay. Could you tell me... Let me see what I... Ive already... As I said to you, Ive already sent something out. I have 10 boxes, which are the file cabinets. Ive taken a lot of it out of the boxes, but thats what I emptied into bags. Okay. Okay. And I dont... What else do you want me to do? So are they in the boxes now? Are they currently in bags? No, theyre in bags at this point, or halves in bag boxes. And then somebody said to me, why dont you find out? Theres no way. This is heavier than I ever thought. You know, Im 82 years old. I mean, I just want to... Im trying to get rid of everything from house building from 10 years ago. And, you know, financial advisor information. So I started doing it. And somebody said, call and see if youre going to get it shredded. So its half and half, but I will put it all into bags. Whatever is more convenient for you. Just so I know, like, I have an accurate count of what youre working with. How many boxes are there and how many bags? Just so we get you an accurate quote. Well, at this point, it would be all bags, but I have emptied out 10 boxes. Okay. Gotcha. So 10 boxes worth are in bags currently. Right. Okay. Perfect. Well, yeah, then we should be all set. Weve got your first and last here, Janice. And this is the best callback number for you? Yes. Okay. Perfect. And your email is JaniceGerard179 at gmail.com? Yes. Okay. Perfect. So what will happen here, just keep an eye out. We will be sending you an email here momentarily that will have the name of each provider as well as their direct phone line so you know whos going to be calling you with a quote. And then a direct line in case you do want to move forward with one of those quotes. And then they will get this sent to them. And theyll be calling you as soon as they are available to let you know what they would charge for that service and what their availability looks like. Okay. Can you give me a general idea what this is? Is it going to be hundreds of dollars or just general? I wont hold you to anything. Unfortunately, Im not on the pricing teams, and we do nationwide services. So I wouldnt really have a good reference on what that costs. I dont get any of that info on my end. But its a no-obligation quote. Its just letting you know what that service would cost for you. All right. So Im aware youve got my number, my information, and you will be sending me somebody that will call me and do this for me. Yes. Absolutely. Okay. Thank you. Youre very welcome. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. Me too. Thank you. Bye-bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Hattie. How can I help you? Yes, hello? Yeah, hi, this is Hattie with Shred Nations.

Like, right now, the boxes are in my basement. Where do they need to be in order to be accessible? They can definitely discuss that with you if you do want to move forward with the quote they give you. Typically, you know, its helpful if you have them fairly accessible, like in a garage or, you know, ready to be taken out to the curb for that truck. Okay. But they can definitely go over, you know, what works best. Okay. All right, so theyll call me back? Is that what youre saying? Yeah. Ill have them call you with a quote. Ill just get this sent over to their pricing team. I just want to make sure I have a point of contact correct. Yeah. Is this the best callback number, the 1325? Yes, it is. Okay, perfect.

So, youll be receiving an email from us momentarily here that will just have their direct line, so you have reference to whos calling you. And then, in case you do want to move forward with... If that quote, youll have that direct line to them as well. So, is the quote coming via email, or does that come in the phone call? Theyll be giving you a call. Im just sending you an email with their contact, so you know whos reaching out, and then you have that for reference. Fine. And do you know how they arrive at the price? Is it just by the amount? I mean, how do they get the price? It can vary by truck. Some of them do it by pound, some of them do it by box, so they can talk over what that looks like for their truck. Okay. Okay. All right. That sounds good. All right. Well, I will get this sent over, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Thank you. Same to you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
