How can I help you? Yeah, do you shred on-site? We have truck services that go to you directly to shred. How many boxes are you shredding? We have four. Four? Whats your zip code? 9207. So for the amount of shredding that you have, I have a truck that can go out there and shred on-site up to nine boxes for $170. If that works, I could have them call you back with price or with scheduling. So I think Im going to pass, but thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it.
