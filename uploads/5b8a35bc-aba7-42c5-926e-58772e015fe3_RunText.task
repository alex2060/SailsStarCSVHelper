This is Marne. How can I help? Yes, good morning. I was just calling to inquire how much you charge to shred documents. How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred roughly? I dont know. How many boxes do you have, Marie? Well, lets just estimate five boxes. Five boxes? Let me see. And whats your zip code? 34237. So for the amount that you would have, we would have a truck service that can go to you and shred. What I can do is gather some contact information and have them call you back for a quote for five boxes, and then you can schedule a day for them to come out if thats okay. Well, Im right here off of Fruitville. I could actually bring it to your business. Do you not do it on site? It is a drop-off at the UPS where youre trying to call. So if you go there, you could take up to 90 pounds. It just depends how much youre going to shred, actually, because five boxes is 150 pounds of paper. If you have that much, a truck is a good option. If you have under 90 pounds of paper, then that UPS store would be your best bet as well. Okay. All right. Well, let me call you back. All right? Yes. Absolutely."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Yes, hi. I wanted to see, to get a quote for some shredding up for papers I have. Yeah, how many boxes of paper are you trying to shred? I dont have boxes. I have about six large black garbage bags. Okay, and the zip code where they would be? 08535. So for the amount that you have, we offer a truck service that goes to you and shreds. What I could do is gather some contact information and have the shredders call you back with pricing and available dates, if thats okay. My brother just said forget it. Thank you anyway."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hi, I was just calling to find out a general price for shredding. I have a few, like, file boxes that were my dads and he passed away, so I just need to have the information shredded. Yeah, absolutely. Roughly how many boxes of paper would you need to shred? I think there is five file boxes, two that are a little bit longer and three that are a little shorter. So two large boxes and three regular? Whats the zip code where everything would be? 28304. So for the amount that you have, we offer a truck service that can go to you and shred. It looks like this shredder can go out for $155. That would cover up to 270 pounds worth of paper to be shred for that price. Oh, wow. No, this is probably not even that weight. So, all right, I didnt realize it would be that much. I thought it would have been significantly less. Is there an option of, like, is it cheaper if it would be brought in? At the UPS, sir, they can charge you per pound over there to do so. Would you like me to transfer you over there for rates and procedures before you go? Sure. Absolutely.

We offer truck services that go to you directly to shred at your residence or business. How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred? Oh, gosh. I dont have a lot. I mean, I thought Id just be able to bring it in. If you wanted to drop off, this is a UPS or on Clark Road. You could go there, and theyre going to charge you per pound there. It can take up to 90 pounds of paper. I could transfer you over there for their rates and procedures. That would be awesome. Thank you. I got you. Absolutely. And did you call me on your cell phone? I did. With who do I have the pleasure? My name is Tina. Tina. In case their bins are filled, Im going to text you some other locations so you could also call them directly and just check availability as well. I hope you have a great day. Oh, thats great. Thank you. Take care."",""Shred Nation, this is Kayla. Yes, good morning. Im speaking with Katerina. Okay. And were actually emailing. She sent me information, and I responded to her yesterday informing her I would like the Shredder truck to show up tomorrow, and Ive not received a response back from her yet. Okay, let me see what Ive got for you here. Okay. So Im not seeing, is this the phone number that you called in on? Or whats your first and last name? Belinda James. B-E-L-I-N-D-A? Yes. All right, let me see. All right, there you are. It looks like youve got 20 boxes. It looks like we connected you with Commonwealth Document Management. We do have your email. Ill resend you their contact info. But Ill get you over to the truck now for the quote, okay? Okay, thank you. Yep, one moment. Thank you for calling the Commonwealth."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Martin Hockenau. Yes, Im sorry. What is your name? Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N. Hi. Okay, Martin. Yeah, you broke off a little bit. Im at Lakehouse West on Clark and Boniva. Whats the minimum amount to do on-site shredding here? Well, we can go to you regardless, but it just depends on how much youre going to shred, how many boxes or bags you have. Whatever the minimum is, I wont have more than that because its not a business. Its just personal stuff that Im going to have to clean out. Would you have like a box worth less than a box? Well, somebody else was saying something about a 64-gallon, which seems like a lot. It sure wouldnt be more than that. No, Ill have more than a box because I have stuff in bags. How many bags? I have no idea. Im not done yet. Do you have a minimum? So the quotes? Yes. So its really going to depend on how much youre shredding. And it looks like you already spoke to us last month. Did you get that job taken care of, Annette? No, I havent done anything. All right, perfect. So what Ill do, I have your email. It looks like first initial, last name at lakehousewest.com. What Ill do is Ill... No, thats not me. Maybe somebody else called you from Lakehouse West. Its an apartment. My email is L, as in Lynn, P, as in Phillip. P, as in Phillip, Walt, W-A-L-T at msn.com. Gotcha. I mean, I havent gathered everything, you know, to put in the bags. But it would be whatever your minimum is to come out and do it. What I will do is since I dont know who called in here on your behalf, but somebody did. Not on my behalf. They didnt do it on my behalf. They probably did it for Lakehouse West, maybe. Gotcha. And this is Annette then? Sorry. Its an apartment building. Oh, gotcha. So its all the same numbers, Im assuming. Right. Gotcha. All right, perfect. Sorry about that. All right. So it just really does depend. So they would give you a quote on how many bags youre going to shred. You tell me how many do you think you would have by the time youre done? Well, I mean, theyre like black garbage bag type things. Yeah, with your best guess. How many of those? Well, one is really heavy. I cant even... I cant even... So you would have one of those, maybe? Maybe two? Oh, no, Ive got more than that. Im sure Id have, well, lets just say five or six. Five or six of those bags, maybe. Perfect. And then whats the zip code where you need service? 34231. Im not ready yet. Im just trying to get prices. Im not ready. So I do... Im just trying to see who I have out there. So I do have a truck service that can go to you, but they do have to call you back with pricing. Pricing. A minimum range that I could give you would be about $100 to about $185 for them to go out. I could have them call you back with an accurate quote now, or you could call us back once you have them in bags to get an accurate count. Right. But then well let you do that. All right. Ill do that. Do you just come once a week in this area or what? Im not too sure of the scheduling. I know that they go there so often, but they do turn around pretty quickly. It could take five to ten business days to put you on the schedule. Ill schedule a little sooner or a little later. Okay. All right. Well, when Im done with the process of cleaning, Ill call you back. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. I hope you have a good one. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. All right. Thank you."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help you?

How do I \u2013 can I bring them to you? Do you guys come fetch them? How does that work? For that amount, we would go to you for them and Shred On site. How many \u2013 or whats the zip code where you need service? 4-6-2-0-3. Im at the corner of Raymond and Southeastern. Got you. Out of residence or business there? Residence. All right. So I do have a truck service that can go to you and Shred On site for $289. That would cover up to 19 of those boxes to be shredded there on site. All right. Im going to do some price checking. Is that the best price you can give? Yeah, correct. Okay. I might be calling you back to \u2013 Im assuming Id have to schedule. Is that correct? Yeah, correct. Definitely. It could take 5 to 10 business days, a little sooner, a little later. And then were leaning next week into a holiday, so it just depends on the time they may have. I get it. Okay. Well, I might be calling you back. I appreciate you. Absolutely. Hope you have a good one. All right. Thanks. Bye-bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Hi, Kayla. My name is Jennifer McElroy, and I was calling to see how your shredding works. Yeah. How many boxes of bags do you have? I probably have two large bags. Okay. So if you have 90 pounds or less and you do not need to witness the shredding, you can take it to the UPS store, your local UPS store. Otherwise, with us, we offer a mobile truck service that comes out to your location. Okay. And how much does that cost? Thats typically between $100 to $180. Thats what I want to do. Okay. All right. So two of the larger, like the big black lawn leaf bags? Yeah. Okay. And what zip code are those in? 08534. 08534. 08534. Cool. And theyre out of residence. All right. So I do have a mobile truck that services the area, but they will only come out for four boxes or more. Do you have any maybe like friends or family, neighbors, anything that would be able to bring over some boxes as well so that you would have a total of four? Probably not. So can I bring it to you? Yeah, you can bring it into the UPS store, yeah. The UPS store, I have to put the stuff in the thing, and they dont shred it when I know. So I dont really want to use it. So thats all I can do. Unfortunately, unless you had four boxes or more. Well, I can make it into four boxes. Okay. So just know that youll be paying for four boxes. But yeah, I can go ahead and get this over to them and have the pricing team. They can call you back. What is your first and last name? Jennifer McElroy, M-C-L-R-O-Y. M-N-I-F-E-R? Correct. Okay. And then your last name? And its M-C, capital E, L-R-O-Y. L-R-O-Y. And then a good email address, please, for the truck. Jennifer McElroy, 829 at gmail.com. My preferred communication is text. Okay. M-C-E-L-R-O-Y. And then what was the numbers at the end of that? 8-9 at gmail. 8-9 at gmail. Okay, perfect. Ill go ahead and get this over to them. Theyll be reaching out to you directly for that quote. And then Ill send you a follow-up email right now with the contact information for the truck, just in case you need that in the future. Okay. And if you dont mind, I did just send you a quick text as well, just to rate my customer service. If you could click five stars, it would make my day. Pardon me? I said if you could click five stars, it would make my day. Okay. Thank you. All right. Youre the best, Jennifer. You have a good one, okay? You too. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

Hey, Im in Florida, Northport, and I see youve got a listing in a UPS store close to me to where I could get a large box of business papers shredded. Is that true? Yeah, absolutely. You could take up to 90 pounds of paper to them. It is drop-off, and theyll charge you per pound to do so. Otherwise, we offer truck services that can go to you and Shred on-site if thats what youre also needing. Okay, lets get some information. Let me write this down if you dont mind, please. So UPS is a drop-off, and they wont do it in front of me, so its per pound. And then if our truck services go to you and Shred, I dont have their pricing in front of me. I would have to gather some contact information. And then they would call you back with pricing and available dates to do that for you. Okay. Could you do that for me? Because Id like to see the stuff shredded in front of me to make sure that I dont have any possible issues. So one box worth of paper youre going to Shred, correct? Yeah. All right, perfect. You know, I could say 90 pounds just because I dont know how much the paper weighs. Okay, and then the best callback number? 517-281-1668, and Ill have to give you my address. Give that to the Shredders if you decide to work with them. The last thing I would need is your email, please. Okay, its O-D-Y-S-S-E-Y-927 at earthlink.net.

But first I need to ask you something else. Do yall destroy the computer too? Yeah. So let me see if we have a truck that will do both. Okay. So unfortunately, we do not have a truck in that area who will do both. So it would have to be separate. But I do have a truck for the paper. Theyll take anywhere from one to nine copy paper boxes. It sounds like you have about four for a flat rate of 155 to come on site and do that. Okay. That would be fine. Whats a good email address for you, Cheryl? Okay. Well, yall have it, but Ill give it to you again because I get stuff from you every day practically. Oh, you do? Okay. Let me look at my system then. One moment. No, I can give it to you if you want me to. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Its Cheryl, S-H-E-R-R-Y-L-J-P at gmail.com. J-P? Yes, maam. At gmail.com. Okay. Perfect.

And how many uniforms do you have? I have six. I think theyre 95-gallon totes full. Okay, so lets see. I wont be able to ship them out. Okay. Thats okay, I understand. I know thats kind of, like, tedious. Yeah, so the only provider in that area, they require it to be shipped out. I dont have any other ones in that area that can do that without having to have it shipped. Im sorry. No, okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Youre welcome. Bye-bye.

Do you rent those for me, Phil, and then somebody comes to pick up? Or do they have to be in boxes? No, it could be that would be like an ongoing service what youre describing. More basically, the truck just comes out like monthly or weekly, however often you need. Theyll just drop off a bin. Is it for an office or like a home business? Um, its I work from home. So, um, so yeah, but I really I wanted it for, you know, maybe like a one time clean out of of everything. So I didnt know if that was an option. Okay, you just want like a bin dropped off to fill up. Okay. Um, yeah, let me let me take a quick look and see. What? We can do. Ill call the provider in your area and just double check and make sure that they would drop off a bin. Um, whats your first and last name? Sure. Its Amy Hathaway. H-A-T-H-E-W-A-Y. Okay, and then a good email for you? Sure. Its ahathaway01 at gmail.com. And then these bins would be dropped off at your house, correct? Yes. Okay, Im going to put you on a brief hold and ask this provider. If they if theyre able, because usually they do that for businesses. But Im going to call them and explain that you kind of work from home and see if theyre able to drop off a bin at your at your residence. Okay. Yeah, if you can just get me a quote, thatd be great. Yeah, yeah. Im just gonna put you on a brief hold real quick. Okay. Sounds good. Thanks. Thank you for calling Legal Shred. Please press one for current customers. A Legal Shred sales representative will be with you in a moment. Thank you for calling Legal Shred where we put the confidence in confidential. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well return to your call shortly. Legal Shred. Good morning. Hi, this is Katerina at Shred Nations. I just have a quick question for you guys. I have a potential customer and they would like she worked from home and she wants a bin dropped off at her house so she can clean out like her home office. Is that something you guys do? Whats the zip code for the location? Its in Talland. Its 06084. Okay. You mean like a bin rental youre saying, right? Yeah. Yeah, she doesnt want a monthly service, though. She just wants, like, a one-time drop-off so she can clean out her office at her house. Well, we do one-time shredding, but we dont do bin rental or bin drop-off. Okay. Okay. All right. Just so I double-check. Sometimes theres providers that do that. But Ill just explain to her it needs to be in boxes, and then Ill email it over to you guys if she agrees. Okay? Yeah, boxes or bags. I mean, but we dont drop off of it and come back later. Lets see. Everythings done in one shot. Okay. Ill make sure I clarify that. Thank you. No problem. Take care. Bye. You too, buddy. Okay. Sorry about that. So it looks like they dont drop off bins unless its, like, a contract. Like, youd have to have, like, a monthly service. So they said they can come and pick up all the paper if you are able to gather it all together and just have it, you know, all ready to go. I mean, it doesnt have to be in boxes. It can be in bags, like trash bags. Okay. But, yeah, and then they can come pick it up. But they just dont drop off bins. Okay. Is there a direct line for them? So, like, when Im done doing this, I can give them a call or should I call you? Just call this number back and then well get you connected with them. Okay. Once we get a box count. Because all we need on our end to send it over to them is just a box count from you. So they kind of have an idea of, like, you know, how to quote you accordingly. Sure. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Yeah. Not a problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Good morning, Kayla. My name is James DeDonna.

"{""text"":[""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hi. Yes, Im calling from the Georgia Department of Community Supervision. Im calling to see if you all offer shredding for state agencies or government agencies. We do not. Are you bidding on the job? No, no, no. We just wanted to. Years ago, we used to have community service workers that worked at the shredding locations, and I could not figure out which one it is. And now we are moving an office, and we just have a large load to shred, and I wanted to see if we could bring documents there. Gotcha. This is a drop-off at the UPS, or youre trying to call, but we offer truck services that can go to you and shred on-site, if thats maybe what you were looking for. No, I was looking for a location that had, like, the shreds been on-site. Gotcha. I guess that would be, you know. Sorry, Im going through this. This is the old Alabama Road location, though? Thats just an office space for us, correct, yeah, but we mainly offer mobile services that go to you and shred. I got you. Okay, okay. I certainly appreciate it. Thank you so much. Hope you have a good one."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hey, I just had a quick question. I saw you online, saw the business online, and I have some shredding that I need. Is that just something I can bring directly to you, or is this like pickup only? We offer truck services that go to you directly, but if you head to this address, it would be a drop-off at the UPS store. They would charge you per pound over there to do so. I can transfer you there for exact rates and procedures. No, thats okay. Which UPS would that be? Actually, youre calling the Surge Speedy on Old Windsor Road, so I could transfer you to this location to get their rates and procedures. Otherwise, the truck can go to you as well. Okay. All right. No, thank you. Have a good one. Have a good one."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help you? Hi, I just got a call from someone in your office. I put in a quote for getting some shredding done, and it said you need more information. Yeah, hey, Jay, hopefully youre doing well. How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred? About three to four. Three to four. Let me see what we have. And youre in zip code 78006? Right. For the amount that you have, I do have a truck that can go to you and shred on site for $195. I could have them call you back with scheduling if that works. Is there a place I can take it? I understood the UPS store in town. Thats where you could drop off is at the UPS, and they have their own rates per pound. I could get you on over there before you go. Okay. All right, Ill get you on over to the one thats on Bandero Road, and then Ill text you another location just in case so you could also call them directly. Okay, that would be perfect. Thank you. All right, take care."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Good morning, Kayla. My name is James DeDonna. I have some files to be shredded, eight boxes. Yeah, how many boxes? Eight? Eight. Okay, let me see what I got for you here. Okay, so eight boxes. And what zip code are those in? 33914. 33914. All right, cool. And are they at a business location or residence?

We have quite a bit of documents here, and were wanting some information about getting them shredded. Okay. Yeah. How many boxes do you have? And I could kind of go over what your options would be. We have those banker boxes, and we have 35 of them. Okay. And are these at a business or a residence? Business. Okay. Could you confirm your zip code for me, please? 47129. Thank you. And you said 35 boxes. Whats the name of the business, please? St. Anthony Catholic Church. Thank you. And then your first and last name? Mary Motherwell. Motherwell, is this how it sounds? M-O-S-T-H-E-L-L-E. M-O-S-T-H-E-R-W-E-L-L? Yes. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Let me just take a quick peek and see what we have in your area. Do you have a good email, Mary? Yes. Its business at stanthony-clarksville.org. And St. Anthony is S-T-Anthony. Oh, okay. Im glad you clarified that. Because I definitely didnt put that in there. So, stanthony-clarksville.org. Okay. Yes. Business at stanthony-clarksville.org. Yep. Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it. So, I have actually two separate providers that route your particular area in Clarksville. So, Im going to send this information over and theyll reach out to you to give you a quote for the 35 boxes that you have. Okay. Just to confirm, do you have the longer boxes, like the 24-inch boxes, or are they just the 15-by-12-inch boxes? Theyre just standard size. Okay. Just the standard bankers box. Okay. All right. And then, are you okay with getting quotes for both on-site and off-site shredding? They both involve a truck coming out, but the only difference is one of the services would have a truck come out, pick everything up, and then they would shred it at their warehouse and then give you a certificate of destruction. Either way. Whatevers the least expensive. Its nothing. Its just old bank documents, that kind of stuff. Okay. Yeah, I think usually the off-site quotes are generally a little bit less costly than the on-site. So, Ill get you quotes for both. That way you kind of have something to compare it with, okay? Yes. Is this the best number to reach you at, Mary? 812-282-2290, and Im extension 2. Okay, great. All right. Im going to get this sent over. Do you have any other questions? No. Do you know when Ill hear something back? Theyre pretty good about calling, like, almost immediately. I would say within at least 30 minutes after we get off the phone. I just send it over to them. Everything we just discussed, Ill send it to them via email. They kind of review it, and then they reach out to give you, like, a formal quote. But Ill make sure to send you an email with their direct contact information, just in case you dont hear anything, okay? Okay. Yeah, because Im going to be in a meeting this morning for a couple of hours, or at least an hour. So, if Im not at my desk, I just want to be able to reach back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ill send you their contact information in your email. That way you can reach out to them if you miss them while youre in the meeting, okay? Thank you. Yeah, not a problem. Have a great day. You too.

Im calling to find out about your facility, is it? It would be medical shredding that I need. Yeah, absolutely. Is it a drop-off place? How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred all together, roughly? Well, right now were just using an in-house shredder, but they get tired after a while. So Im not sure to detect the amount. Are you looking for ongoing service or just a one-time shred? No, ongoing service, but were kind of in practice. Weve only been around. Just three years. So we dont have, like, you know, like gallons and gallons of paper. And we were just looking for drop-off services first. If youre looking for drop-off, I would refer you to the UPS store over there. Theyre going to charge you per pound. You could take up to 90 pounds of paper to them at a time. Usually they have you feed the paper a couple sheets at a time into a locked bin, I will say. So if you are needing. Like an ongoing service, we offer truck services that can put a bin at the business, and then they pick it up monthly, quarterly, weekly, whatever frequency you would need as well. And whats the minimum size for the pickup tray? The console, which is the smallest container they have, holds about four banker boxes worth of paper. Oh, thats probably good. And then how often would you think you need pickup service? Thats what well have to figure out. How do you charge then? Do you charge by the pickup services? Well, theyll put you on a schedule. Would you like a quote for maybe quarterly, bimonthly? I would say bimonthly. Bimonthly. All right, perfect. And then whats the zip code where you would need service? 34135. Thank you.

They run on like a flat fee. So UPS charges per pound. I dont know the exact pricing per pound. I know its between $1 to $2 a pound. The truck service. I would have to have him reach out to you directly. I can transfer you over to him to get you a quote while I have you on the phone. Do you have like a general idea? Were talking a couple hundred dollars at least, right? It ranges from like $100 to $195. No more than $200. Thats at the very most. I mean, thats at the very most. Okay. Ill call the UPS store and work with them. If we got to do it in stages, well do it in stages. Would you like me to transfer you to the UPS store? Yeah, sure. Thatd be great. Okay.

So I just take it in there, and then what happens then once I drop it off? You would feed it into a locked bin. And then you guys would come shred it there? Yeah, whenever the bin is full, it would be shredded. And then how much? What should they charge per pound, do you know? I do not. Each store sets their own pricing. Gotcha. Okay, so the UPS store. Got it. Thank you very much. Yeah, absolutely."",""hi thank you for calling shred nations this is kaylee how can i help you hi kaylee um i have a quick question when you do shredding can you um have uh the metal folders in there or do they need to be taken out the hanging folders no you can leave any any of the hanging folders theres no hard metals like the big black binder clips but like paper clips staples any of the hanging files if theyre like industrial size hanging file folders those have to come out but just the typical ones that you see like in a doctors or dentists office those can stay in those can stay in okay great because im just going through everything and im saying oh these are all in hanging folders do i have to take them all out yeah no you youll be fine okay thank you so much for your help thanks anytime take care bye"",""Shred Nation, this is Kayla.

You have your email for the truck, but if you really, really dont want to, you dont need to. Yeah, let me ask you this. Im leaving Thursday morning for about a week, and Ive been cleaning out all my paperwork, and Id really like to get rid of all this stuff before I leave. Is there a possibility that I can have it shredded either today or tomorrow? Looking for a service before Thursday. It looks like theyre pretty close to you. The truck does run on a route, but when I get you over to the pricing team right now, if you like the quote, you can... Go ahead and ask if you can get in before Thursday. It looks like you should be able to. Yeah, I mean, I dont mind bringing it to someone. They dont actually have to come to my home. Thats... Unless theyre going right by, but thats fine.

And how many boxes do we have? Oh, God, I dont know. I mean, Ive still got to continue boxing them up for many, like at least 20. All right. So is that going to be your best estimate? Well, it is for now. I mean, until theyre boxing, I can give you an exact amount. Okay. Lets see here. So you want to get a quote for 20? Is that how much youll think youll have at the end? Yeah. And I would guess each one of them is probably, I dont know, 25 pounds maybe. Okay. Perfect. Theyre like bankers boxes? Yeah. Okay. And theyre at a business location in Salem? Yes. 1-0-1-9-7-0. All right. Let me see what I got for a truck. Nice. It looks like I do have three trucks that service the area. So youll get three quotes. You can go with whichever ones best for your budget as well as your schedule. Youll get two on-site quotes. Theyll come and shred on-site. And then one off-site quote. Theyll pick up the documents, shred them at their facility, and provide you with a certificate of destruction. That way you can kind of see what both of those prices look like. And the only thing I need is a good e-mail address, please, for the quotes. Sure. The e-mail address is L as in Larry, G as in girl, and then my last name, Ternes, T-E-R-N-E-S, at gmail.com. All right. Awesome. I will go ahead and get this over to the trucks. Theyll contact you directly for the quotes. Lets see. Okay. Perfect. And then Ill send you a follow-up e-mail with the contact information for each of them. That way if you need it in the future, you have it. And at the bottom of that e-mail, theres a little portion to rate my customer service. If you could click five stars, it would make my day. That would be great. Let me ask you one other question. I presume, irrespective of what method is used, I need to get all the boxes down to the ground floor. Is that correct? Im not getting any help in moving them. Is that correct? I dont see any notes here that they dont do stairs, so they might be helping you. They might be able to do that. Okay. All right. All right. Well, Ill wait to hear from them. All right. Thank you very much. Absolutely. You have a great day. Thank you, too. Bye now. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Martin. How can I help?

Do I just go in and do that or do I have to make an appointment to do it? So how many boxes do you have? Its just one box of papers. Okay, let me take a look. So yeah, your best option would probably, no, youre okay. Your best option would probably be the UPS store. Its a drop-off location. Yeah, thatd probably be your best option. What was your question? Im sorry. You know, if I can just go in there to the UPS store and just drop off the box or, because I know that the Shred Nation is at UPS store, but its not Shred Nation, so Im confused. Do I just go to the UPS store and drop the box off there? Yeah, so you can just go in during regular business hours. Okay. And yeah, just go in during regular business hours and then you hand feed them into a locked trash can. Oh, okay. Got it. And then theyll charge you per pound. Yep. Okay, thank you. Youre welcome.

Would you like to write down their phone number to call them directly? No, I cant read or write because I have a macular deception. Is there another company that I have to deal with? No, so theyre going to be calling you directly. With pricing, it was just, you know, if I could give you that contact info, but not a problem. They should be giving you a call back today.

Im good. Thank you. I needed some shredding for an office setting that is in a secured location. So I put a quote out there online, and Martin called me back and asked some questions, which were good questions. I wondered, are you able to call up my email or my request for a quote, and maybe we can start from there? Okay, good. Okay, yeah. I see your information in here. Whats the amount of boxes that you would like to have? It was quoted as 212 cubic feet, you would say, to be on the safe side. I dont know how that translates to individual pieces of paper, but I think we should go with a little bit higher estimate so its not underpriced. Well, actually, if you have 212 cubic feet, I can... Simply just do the math for that to see about how many boxes youre estimating. So if my calculations are correct, I believe its about 176 boxes. Okay. And so this is going to be in the zip code 23509? No, its going to be in Newport News for the offices. Okay, whats the zip code? Im driving, so I cant look it up, but I think its, like, for Hampton, its 23666. For Newport News, it would... Im sorry, I should have that memorized, and I dont. Okay, well, we are zip code specific, so I would need that information if you can please let us know. I mean, you can always respond to the email. Sure. With that information, if you dont have that on you, write this second. But we do have everything else we would need. We just need that zip code where the boxes are. Can I put you on hold for just a second and ask Siri what the zip code is? Okay, hold on then, and Ill be right back. Okay. Hey, Siri. Hey, this is for Patrick Henry Field Airport in Newport News, Virginia. Okay, perfect. So there are a couple shutters who brought that area, Michael. I can send this information over to both of them, and then they would be able to call you back with some pricing and available dates for that. And then you can go with the best option.

"{""text"":[""This is Katerina with Shred Nations. Can I help you? Hello. Hi. My name is Rubia. I wanted to ask for shredding documents, how much does it cost? Do you have a price? So it depends on a few different verticals. How many boxes do you have? Like two. So I work at a law firm. Its like legal documents where it has extensive information. I need that all shredded. So its like, I would say like two, three pounds of papers, maybe more than that. Okay. But you need a witness to shredding, right? Yeah. I would need a witness that like saying that like all this paper was shredded. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Whats your zip code? Were in Leesburg, 20170. 20. Im sorry. Say that one more time. You cut out. 20176. Thank you. And you have two boxes, you said? Or two pounds? Yeah. I would say two boxes, like two boxes of papers. Okay. Yeah, thats fine. So I do have a trucking company in your area. Im going to just gather a few things from my end, on my end, and then I could get you in touch with them for a quote, okay? Yeah. Sure. But is it going to be hundreds of dollars? I mean, it ranges between like 100 to 195 for the mobile truck service. No, I dont need a truck service. Is there a place where I can come to you? Theres no. And you do some shredding. No. So theres a drop-off service where you put them into a locked trash can, but you dont get a witness to shredding. So once its in the trash can, its like, its shredded 100%? Yeah. Well, yeah. So they empty their bin. Its at UPS. They empty their bins like once a month, I think. Each store is kind of franchised, so they do their own pricing and their own, they set their own like times when they have it picked up. But I believe, yeah, its once a month, but its until a secure, its like a secure drop-off. But I know that law offices, sometimes you need to like have it, the documents have to be disposed of, like compliant with certain laws. So just so youre aware, like the UPS store isnt, follow those. Yeah. I just dont want paper to be sitting there, you know? Yeah. I dont understand. I think, I know it seems kind of silly to pay like hundreds of dollars for just a couple boxes. I think maybe it might be a better option just to wait until you have more volume, if thats possible. Yeah. Ill check with my boss. Ill let you know. But is there any shredding service where I drop things off and it gets shredded? Would you know? No, not within our network. I know theres companies that do. But just in our network of what we offer, there isnt. But I know its more impossible to find someone. So if you just keep calling around, Im sure youd be able to find someone that can kind of accommodate what youre needing. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Not a problem. Bye-bye."",""Shred Nation, this is Kayla. Hi, Kayla. I called a couple days ago for a mobile service to come to my home, and no one called me back. Oh, okay. Let me see who we connected you as. This is Peter? Yeah, Peter. Yep. Okay. Let me see here. Looks like we connected you with New England Security Shredders, that you should have an email from us with their direct phone number. I just sent it again in case you havent gotten it. Make sure it doesnt end up in your spam. But I will get you over to the truck now, okay? Yep, thanks. Absolutely."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help you? Hi, Martin. My name is Betsy. I have some questions about a shredding job that I need to get taken care of. Yeah, absolutely. Roughly how many boxes of paper are you shredding? Approximately 12 to 14, slightly bigger than a banker box. Okay, and then the zip code where they would be? 17078. Residential or business? Its a remote business. I work from home, and Im leaving the company, and Ive been instructed to dispose of the files. Okay. So for the amount of shredding that you have, we have a truck that would go to you and Shred Onsite for $289, and that would cover up to 19 of those boxes. So unless you go over that, pricing would change. Okay. And now, is it just paper? Paper. Can it be file folders? The folders could remain there as well. If they cant shred them onsite, what they usually do is they take them and shred them offsite, and they do give you a certificate of destruction to prove it has been shred. Oh, yeah. Im just talking about like manila file folders that the papers are in. That is correct. Do I have to take the papers out? No, you dont have to. If they can shred them, theyll shred them onsite. If for whatever reason they cant shred them onsite. Theyre going to shred those offsite. Okay. And I would need to remove, Im sure, binder clips. What about rubber bands? They can remove those as well for you if they shred them offsite for you. You wouldnt have to do it yourself. And then hanging folders should be removed because of the metal strips in them? The shredders, again, help you remove those as well. Okay. And do I have to like schedule an appointment for that? That is correct. Yeah. They dont do same day or next day. Scheduling can take five to ten business days, a little sooner, a little later. Okay. And then how would I make payment for that? I believe they accept card cash, but thats something theyll have to go over with you. Once youre ready, well gather some info and transfer you to the shredder, and theyll put you on the schedule and go over any other logistics with you. Okay. And can I call you back at this same number? Yeah. I need to get authorization to expense this. I got you. Yeah, of course. Give us a call back. My name is Martin. If not me, somebody else here would definitely help you as well. Okay. And they would come to the house. Correct. That would be fantastic. All right. And where would be a tipping point? You know, if I would go through and I have no idea how many hanging folders are in there that it might reduce it, you know, like down to... 10 boxes. Is that going to make any difference in pricing? Itll be the same price. So the quote for $289 covers from 10 to 19 boxes. 10 to 19. Okay. All right. Well, thank you, Martin. I will get a hold of my boss and see, you know, say, hey, this is what its going to cost you to get rid of this stuff. All right. Thank you. I will give you a call back. Have a good one."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Hi, good morning. I live in Brooklyn, and I was wondering if somebody could come to me to get my papers that needed to be shredded. Yeah, how many boxes or bags do you have? I have about maybe 12 bags here, but theyre in recycled bags that I get from the supermarket. Like grocery bags? Yes. Okay. So thats going to be about three boxes. If you dont need to witness the shredding, you can take it to the UPS store over on Flatbush Avenue. They can take up to three boxes. Thats about what you have. Otherwise, if you wanted to witness it, it would be the mobile truck that comes out to your location and shreds on site. Yeah, I need somebody to come because... Okay, what zip code are you in? Im in 11238. Im on Washington Avenue between Fulton and Atlantic. Okay. Okay, so it looks like I do have a truck that services the area. Theyll take anywhere from one to nine boxes for a flat rate of $189. Okay. Does that work? Yeah, thatll work for me because... Okay. And then whats your first and last name? I injured my knee. Im walking with a cane now, so... Oh, Im so sorry about that. And whats your first and last name? My name is Gina McDuffie. Is that G-I-N-A? Yes. And then M-C, capital D? Yeah, U-F-F-I-E. Perfect. And whats a good email address for you, Gina? Gina, lowercase, 1434 at msn.com. Awesome. And what is the address that the truck will be coming to? 545 Washington Avenue between Fulton and Atlantic. Okay. Awesome. Ill get you over to the scheduling team now, and then Ill send you a follow-up email with the directions. Ill send you a phone number for the truck just in case you need that in the future. And then at the bottom of that email, theres a little portion to rate my customer service. If you could click five stars, it would make my day. Okay. And can I pay with credit card? I believe so, yep. I would confirm that with the scheduling team. Okay. All right. One moment, okay? All right. Hi, Im Chard. How can I help you? Hey, this is Kayla with Shred Nations, and who am I speaking with? This is Kay. Hey, Kay. Im sorry. So Ive got another pre-sold for you. This is Gina. Shes got about three boxes at her residence in Brooklyn. The zip code is 11238. She has agreed to the 189. No problem. All right. Here she is."",""Shred Nation, this is Kayla. Yes, this is Robin Freche calling. I am calling because in the course of cleaning out our parents farm, we found several barrels of old business documents my father had. And I think that, are you calling from a Minnesota location or are you in a central? How many boxes or bags do you have to shred? Im sorry, I couldnt hear you. How many boxes or bags do you have to shred? Well, first of all, I need to find if they can be. Weve probably got about maybe eight garbage bags full. Are those like the tall white kitchen garbage bags or like the big black contractor bags? I think the contractor bags. Well, theyre in barrels. Its kind of hard for me to tell. And I did look online to see what, is what can be shredded. Its going to be a mobile truck that comes out to your location and shreds on site for you to witness. What zip code are those in? Its 56292. But I need a chance to tell you whats going on, if thats okay. So were not always at the farm. And some of the things are in plastic bags and some are the old-fashioned blueprint paper, you know, those notepads where they would write you a receipt and there was a duplicate. Are those shreddable? I believe so, yes. Yeah, but Id have to just see here. Let me see. So actually, it looks like I do not have a mobile truck that services the area. So another option would be at the UPS store on Adams Street in Mankato. Theyre going to charge by the pound there. Okay. All right. So how do I know if that can be shredded or not? Ill get you over to them right now for pricing and policy, if youd like. Okay, thank you. You have one moment.

So whats the cost of shredding? Is it a box? So they do it per pound. Its weighed per pound. I can transfer you to the UPS store if youd like, and they can kind of give you an idea of what that pricing would look like. Would you like me to transfer you? Yes, please. Okay, one second."",""Hi, this is Katerina from Shred Nations. Can I help you? Hi, Katerina. This is Marilyn Kaiser calling. I spoke to someone on Saturday, and she said that someone was supposed to get back to me yesterday, but I never heard from anybody. Okay. All right. Let me see. My name is Marilyn Kaiser, K-E-Y-S-E-R. Yeah, I see you here in our system. Let me just take a quick look and see who we got you in touch with. Okay, yeah. So, yeah, let me look and see what we have in your area. You just have four to five boxes at your residence, correct? It may be a little bit more than that. I cant tell because we put everything in these big bins. So, Im thinking maybe five, six boxes, but theyre not in boxes. Okay. Are they in bags? Nope. Its all in boxes. Its all in totes, big totes. Okay. Did you need on-site shredding, or would you be okay with off-site shredding? I would like on-site, if possible. Okay. So, Id have to call the one provider. I dont think theyve reached that back out yet. Do you mind if I put you in a brief hold, and Ill try calling him again real quick? No problem. Thank you. Youre welcome. Youve reached the office of Rob Schager. Please leave a message with your name, phone number, and the purpose of your call, and I will return your call as soon as possible. Okay. Sorry about that. Yeah, I went straight to his voicemail. So, at this point, yeah, I see Jacqueline did put the notes in. We are waiting for someone to give us a call back because theres no providers popping up in that specific area of New York. Okay. Because someone called me from a toy number. Okay. That could have been one of us. I mean, Im not sure. But all I know is that... Yeah, were waiting to hear back from the provider to see if theyd be willing to take on the job because they dont usually go in that area. All right. So, Ill save your info in here, and then, I mean, when Jacqueline hears back, shell definitely reach out to you. Okay. So, what youre saying is that you have nobody in this area to do this? Yeah. As of right now, no. Okay. I have somebody... Someone else I could call that is local. Okay. Okay. Maybe I could do that instead. Yeah, I would try looking around for other companies just in case because we dont have anyone in that area in our network. Im sorry. All right. Thank you for your help. Youre welcome. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Hello, my name is William Keller. Ive been in touch online. I wanted to see if I could confirm some reservations for shredding at my office.

Bill Keller Insurance. Bill Keller? Yeah, Bill Keller Insurance. All right, and your name is William Keller? Yes. Okay, perfect. And then just a good email address, please, for the quotes. Okay, its the same one youve been emailing me at. Its bkmail12 at gmail.com. Thats M-A-I-L. Uh-huh, M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L.

I have tons of financial documents from my parents who passed away within the last three years. Okay. Is it something that I can put in the shredder myself, or is it something where I just leave a box and you guys do it? It really just depends. How many bags or boxes do you currently have to shred? Well, I have a full box, you know, one of those W.B. Mason paper boxes. Theres 10 ranges. Thats filled with papers. Okay, so the UPS store is for three boxes or less. You can go into the UPS store, but youd be hand-feeding it into a locked trash can, and they would shred at a later time. Okay. Alternatively, we have the option. We have the option of a mobile truck service that can come out to you and shred everything on a scheduled date. The range for the price is between, like, $100 to $195. Wow. No, I dont have that much. Yeah. All right. Ill have to keep looking into it. Its a lot, but its not that much just to throw in. My shredder keeps getting clogged up. I have a, you know, just not a commercial shredder. And I have to keep taking it apart and pulling the paper out, so its a pain in the butt. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Okay. Ill keep researching, because Id like to do it myself. Id like to find a place where I can just take the papers and throw it into a machine myself. Yeah, no, I understand. I know that there are companies that offer that. It is within our network. I dont see anyone that offers that service, but there are companies that do allow people to just drop off stuff. So if you keep looking, Im sure youll be able to find someone. All right. Thanks so much. Youre welcome. Bye-bye. Bye. Have a good day. You too. Bye.""],""Prompt"":[""DEFINITION: Did the agent use helpful language and show willingness to assist?

How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred roughly? So I guess like I dont, I call it like a few other places to try to get quotes. Um, so what, what Im trying to do is theres probably going to be at least maybe like 96 gallon. I know thatll be full. So I just dont know if you, I thought about just getting a shred then, buying one, or if you provide them, that would be great. I dont know if you do mobile shredding or if you just, if I come to the site, Im just trying to figure out how that functions. I dont know anything. Yeah. We offer truck services that go to you. They only drop off in there if its for ongoing service. So if youre looking for like something monthly, but if you could fill up one of those bins worth of paper, thats about 10 boxes worth roughly, roughly how much you think youre going to have, or maybe double that, triple that. Um, it wouldnt. So whatever goes in that bin, I dont know. Its just about, uh, so maybe one of those bins. Yeah. Maybe one is, yeah, because like, well, when you say boxes, like what are the parameters of the boxes? Thats why Im kind of confused. What you buy paper in. So when you go to Office Mac or Office Depot, you buy paper in a box thats the size. Oh, youre talking about that. Yeah. We could also use lawn bags, kitchen bags. Were just trying to figure out the volume, but since you mentioned one of those 96 gallon bins, one of them holds about 300 pounds. So if you end up having two, that could be close to six. 600 pounds. So if youre anywhere in that range, I could have them give you a quote for that amount. Um, so lets do the one because see, I didnt know that you could just bring the bags up there. Thats different. Yeah. And then whats the zip code where you would need service? 63136. Okay. For a business, you said? Um, its for a small business. Yeah. And then, um, Oh, Im sorry. Uh, can you say that again? How about any hard drives, laptops or cell phones at all? No. All right. Perfect. Nothing does that magnitude. This is just all paper. Got you. For this amount, I do have a couple of shredders that route there. Could I gather some contact information and have them call you back with pricing and available dates? Um, I really kind of needed to know, um, or if I just drop it off, what is the, whats your standard shredding? Just for, to drop off, we refer to the UPS stores over there. You can only take up, up to 90 pounds of paper and youre going to have to individually feed a couple of sheets at a time into a locked bin there. So if youre anticipating about 300 pounds of paper, the truck service is going to be the way to go. Okay. Okay. So youre, you just have a shred bin thats on a site at UPS. Okay. I misunderstood. Correct. Oh, okay. Yeah. I didnt know that. I thought you, uh, okay. So thats what youre talking about. Okay. So youre, you just have a shred bin thats on a site at UPS. Okay. So thats why you were like, somebody has to come out to you and vice versa. Okay. Correct. So, um, yeah, because I needed it for my, uh, for my small business and residential. Gotcha. Um, I could have them go to the residence if youd like, or business, which do you prefer? Some of them dont go to either or. Yeah. Well, I needed the pricing for both. So thats why I was, uh, So well do residential. Well, I could just get the residence. Okay. Yeah. That way in case its business, they can also go to you. Um, but Ill gather your info and theyll call you back. Whats the best callback number? 314-786-2821. Your first and last name? Uh, my name is Carmen. Carmen? Uh huh. And your last name? Um, I dont know if Im using a service, so is it just so you can create a profile? Your last initial, I just do need to put that down. Yeah. J. J is fine. J. Thank you. And last thing would be your email. Okay. You can do CJs Cakes and Desserts. Im sorry. My, oh my Jesus, I cant even get it out. MyCJsCakesandatgmail.com. Sorry about that. Cakes is plural or singular? Plural. So MyCJsCakesatgmail.com. At gmail. Thank you. Im going to put you on a brief hold and Im going to get you on over to the shredder for pricing.

Ill send you their information now and theyll be calling you as soon as they can. Do you know what the turnaround time is? I dont unfortunately. It shouldnt be too much longer for them to do so though. All right. Thanks. Okay."",""Hi, this is Katerina with Shred Nations. Can I help you? Hi, Katerina. I live in Milford, Connecticut, and apparently you have a place on Cherry Street in Milford. And I wanted to get \u2013 I have some questions. I need some stuff shredded. Do I just, like, drop it off? Yeah, so how many boxes do you have? Im sorry. Well, I dont know yet for sure. Im just asking questions. Okay, so the drop-off service is meant for, like, small volumes, typically, like, three boxes or less or three bags or less. If you have more than that, then it would be a mobile truck service that comes out to your house on a scheduled date and shreds everything right in front of you. Okay, so why dont you give me the prices on both that? Im not sure how much Ill have. Okay, so by three bags, you mean, like, big garbage bags? Yeah, like the black \u2013 yeah, the black lawn and leaf bags. Okay, I dont think I have more than that. I know I dont have more than that, so. Okay, so then Im going to transfer you to the UPS store so they can give you an idea of what their price per pound would be. Is that okay? Oh, no, Ive already talked to the UPS store. I got their prices. Are you the same people? Yeah, theyre our drop-off service. We offer more of a mobile truck service. It ranges between, like, $100 to $195 for the first few boxes, just to kind of give you an idea. But really, to get you an accurate \u2013 $100 to $195. To get you an accurate quote, I do need a volume, though. Its kind of hard to assess a situation without a volume. Sure, I understand. Okay, well, you know what? I think you gave me some good information. Okay. Ill have to put my stuff together and really see how much I have. Okay. Yeah, and like I said, if you exceed those three boxes, youre more than welcome to give us a call back, and we could definitely go over what options would be available to you, okay? Perfect. Thanks so much. Yeah, not a problem. Have a good day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Martin Hockenau. Hi, is it Mark? Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N. Martin, Im sorry.

I just want to know if I can bring some documents to shred at the location? So you wouldnt get to witness the shredding. It would be put into a locked trash can. Youd hand feed it into like a locked trash can, and they would shred at a later time for the drop-off service. Alternatively, if you need to witness the shredding, we do have a mobile truck service. Okay, no, Ill bring it up. The thing is that you have some personal information in the document. And I want to know like how safe it is. Like nobodys going to read the document? Thats my question. I mean, I dont know how UPS does their, I just know that they put it into a locked trash can. Thats all I know. Obviously, theres nothing more secure than just watching your paper be shredding or shredded. So thats where a mobile truck service would come in. But UPS, each ones franchised. I dont have that one. Its just documents. Its just like a bag of papers. Okay. How about this? Do you mind if I transfer you to the UPS store, and they can kind of go over their process with you and let you know how it works? No, its okay. No, I just wanted to know how well services you offer.

"{""text"":[""Shred Nations, this is Hedy. How can I help you? Hi, I was trying to reach Kayla. She is on the other line right now, but I can help you out here. What can we do for you? My name is Kim. Im calling with Roto-Rooter Service Company. I was looking for some quotes on doing some shredding in the branch here. Okay, absolutely. I see your form here that you would put in online. How many boxes or bags did you have to be shredded? In all honesty, Im not 100% sure. My GM is talking about possibly opening up options for our employees to bring in personal stuff from home to shred along with what we have. I dont know. Can we get a quote maybe based? Based on possibly 250 boxes. Im not sure on what you guys offer, if its a truck on site, if it has to be removed to be shredded, things of that sort. Yeah, we do have mobile services, and it looks like we do have a truck in your area. Would this more \u2013 I guess Im trying to think here what would be the best option. I do have a truck that can do a shredding event, so thats where the truck would stay there for however many hours, and then everyone could bring things in. Or would you want to accumulate all of the boxes and then just have a truck come and do it all at once? Can I get a quote on both options? Because some of it would depend on \u2013 I mean, were not in a rush to do it. Im just trying to get this set up for a start and then current. So youre literally shredding after that so that we dont keep accumulating? Yeah, absolutely. And I dont know if it would be a continued thing for all of our employees to do it or just per se, just the company stuff. Okay, gotcha. Let me think here. So if we were wanting to get a quote for, like, the one-time purge, not a shredding event, I would need to know the rough estimate of the volume, the total volume that you would have to be shredded. Or if you just wanted to start with looking at what a shred event would look like, we could go based on that. I would almost think \u2013 and you go by, like, the paper box size? Because I think we might be at, give or take, if we were just to get rid of ourselves, maybe a hundred boxes. Okay, gotcha. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. We can definitely go based on that here. Okay. And are there any electronics that need destruction as well, to your knowledge, like hard drives, laptops, cell phones, tablets, or is it just paper? Just paper right now. Okay. We most of the time have to send all of our stuff back to corporate, so. Okay, gotcha. Not a problem. I just have \u2013 I have a truck that does both. Thats the only reason that I ask. But I do have two trucks that could do the service for you. So what Ill do here is just confirm the point of contact info you had put in online and make sure we got everything correct, and then well get that sent over to the pricing team so they can each reach out to you with a quote for the hundred boxes there. And then if, you know, youre thinking itll be more volume than that, you know, you can definitely talk over your options there, as long as we know what the minimum would be. All right. So we got your first last name, Roto Rooter Services Company. Mm-hmm. Okay, perfect. And this is the best callback number for you? Yeah, I could give you a cell phone number, too, if you would like. Okay, yeah, up to you. We actually just changed \u2013 we just changed our phone lines. Everything is going through Teams now, so its \u2013 theres no extension. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. But \u2013 Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. The 398 is the office number here. Okay. My cell phone would be 816-654-3238. 3238. All right. And would you like that cell phone as the secondary or the primary phone number? I would probably do it secondary because I dont pick it up if I dont know who you are. Okay, yeah. No, not a problem. Not a problem. So, what well do here, keep an eye out, well send an email over to \u2013 its kim.stewart at rrsc.com. Correct. Well send an email over thatll have each of their direct lines just to give reference to whos going to be calling you with a quote for that service.

How big is the garbage bin? Are we talking like a 96-gallon bin, 64, 32? Oh, Jesus Christ. So a 96 is like the large size that you would wheel out to the curb for a trash pickup? Thats probably about it. Okay. So maybe one of those. So, yeah, it looks like we cant. Im going to go ahead and get you some information on the truck service in that area. Let me gather a little information from you, and then Im going to have the shredder that does service Flossmoor get you some pricing and some information. Whats your first and last name? Safina.
