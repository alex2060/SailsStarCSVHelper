My husband called a while ago and was trying to set up an appointment to have some stuff shredded, and someone said theyd get back to us. BIT, N-E-R. Yeah, I got this out, like, earlier today. So the shredders, they probably will still be in the office. I dont know if theyre in yet, but theyre going to be calling you as soon as they are available. Well check the e-mail for Don, and he has their phone number, so you could try to call them. But the problem is my husbands playing golf, and I dont have the particulars on anything, so Im just trying to keep... Theyll be calling you. Yeah, it shouldnt be. They might call today, but theyll have to reach out, unfortunately, give us some time. I see. Is there a possibility that I can get on a schedule for Thursday morning, do you think? Uh, it depends on the scheduling. They typically dont do same day or next day. I know Thursday, it just depends on the day theyre in your area, but theyll have to let you know, unfortunately. All right. Thank you. What number do they have to call? Do you know? Ill give you the number if youre ready. Yes. All right. If youre ready, their phone number is 984-203-2641. Do they come out of Ocean Isles, or are they coming from somewhere else? We work nationwide, so I dont know where they route out of, but when they call, ask them, and theyll let you know where they come out of. Oh, I see. So Im not calling a local number right now. Im calling... Well, theres... Yeah, we work nationwide, so yeah, these guys do route there, but yeah, I dont know where they route out of. All right. Thank you.

I was just checking to see how much it would cost to have some, I have some boxes like you get from the office depot to put your legal stuff in, you know. Yeah. I dont have some of those on. It looks like we spoke with you yesterday and we quoted you. So, okay, well, I have two numbers here. And so I wasnt sure if this was the same one. So, yes, you did speak to me. Yes, yes, yes. So we quoted you the 155. Did you want to move forward with that quote? Well, Im going to have to check to make sure its okay with him, but sounds good to me. But, and then I think they told me that you would come to my house and. Yes, maam. And shred it on site. Yes. Yall dont have, yall do not have a place to go that I could care, you know, where it would be cheaper for me or, or, or not. So, I mean, the drop off service would actually cost more money because they price it per pound. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, let me check. So either number that I call will be fine. Is that correct? Yeah, I can give you our direct office number if that might be easier for you. Yes, that would be great. Okay. Let me know when youre ready. Im ready. 8 0 0 7 4 7 3 3 6 5. So when I speak to someone at this number, then I can tell them what I want and we can send it. Yes, maam. Yeah. And Ill make a note in there that youll be calling back when youre ready to move forward with the quote. Yes. Okay. All right. Well, and so that shouldnt be any surprises. It should be $165, correct? Yes. For the amount. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When, for the amount that you gave us. Yes. Okay. Okay. Well, good. Well, thank you so much. Youre welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

We are actually looking at having bins dropped off for an event. No, not an ongoing service. Its actually for an event that were doing. Do you guys, is that possible to have bins dropped off and picked up just for a single event? No, not unless its like ongoing services. Okay. How do you guys do like a Shred event? A Shred event, you would basically rent out the truck and driver, and they would come on site and shred whatever boxes or bags that you accumulated from the event. Okay. Let me see here. Okay. So, basically, if its just a one-time service, if were going to have more than just boxes or bags, like a, well, I guess, tell me what are your parameters, like if we were to say, you know... Okay. Okay. What zip code are you located in? Im not even, Im not sure if we said the area. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Were just in Wilmington. Its 28405. Do Shred events in the area? Im sorry. Oh, okay. All right. Do you guys not service all of Wilmington? Like we service, like for shredding, but not for Shred events, it looks like. Gotcha. You guys just do like ongoing Shredding service. Like one-time pickups. One-time pickups. We dont leave bins. Gotcha. We dont leave boxes or bags. We only leave the little boxes or boxes you had at that time to Shred. Oh, okay. Well, can you tell me about the one-time pickup? For how many boxes? Well, without being able to estimate that, do you guys have like, you know, if you are picking up X amount, it costs this much. If youre picking up this amount, it costs this much. Do you have a standard like that? Is this for a business or a residence? Its for a business. I only have pricing for up to nine boxes. it would be a flat rate of $155 to have the mobile truck come out gotcha alrighty well thank you for the information of course bye"",""Shred Nation, this is Brie. Hi, Brie. My name is Kay Craig, and Im calling to find out about your shredding services. How do they work? Are you looking for a drop-off location, or did you want a mobile truck to come out so you could witness the shredding on site? A drop-off location is fine. Okay. Its a pretty big drop-off. Its a big drop-off. Is it under 90 pounds? What does a box usually full of documents weigh? Its probably close to 90. No, its probably more than that, then. All right, so then you would need to have a mobile truck come out and shred for you if you have more than 90 pounds. Okay. All right. It would be $155 to have the mobile truck come out and shred on site so you could witness it. Okay, when does that happen? When can that happen? If youre interested in that, I can get some additional information and get it over to Skyline. Okay. And then when youre done scheduling, they reach out with availability for you. Okay.
