But the problem is my husbands playing golf, and I dont have the particulars on anything, so Im just trying to keep... Theyll be calling you. Yeah, it shouldnt be. They might call today, but theyll have to reach out, unfortunately, give us some time. I see. Is there a possibility that I can get on a schedule for Thursday morning, do you think? Uh, it depends on the scheduling. They typically dont do same day or next day. I know Thursday, it just depends on the day theyre in your area, but theyll have to let you know, unfortunately. All right. Thank you. What number do they have to call? Do you know? Ill give you the number if youre ready. Yes. All right. If youre ready, their phone number is 984-203-2641. Do they come out of Ocean Isles, or are they coming from somewhere else? We work nationwide, so I dont know where they route out of, but when they call, ask them, and theyll let you know where they come out of. Oh, I see. So Im not calling a local number right now.

We are actually looking at having bins dropped off for an event. No, not an ongoing service. Its actually for an event that were doing. Do you guys, is that possible to have bins dropped off and picked up just for a single event? No, not unless its like ongoing services. Okay. How do you guys do like a Shred event? A Shred event, you would basically rent out the truck and driver, and they would come on site and shred whatever boxes or bags that you accumulated from the event. Okay. Let me see here. Okay. So, basically, if its just a one-time service, if were going to have more than just boxes or bags, like a, well, I guess, tell me what are your parameters, like if we were to say, you know... Okay. Okay. What zip code are you located in? Im not even, Im not sure if we said the area. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Were just in Wilmington. Its 28405. Do Shred events in the area? Im sorry. Oh, okay. All right. Do you guys not service all of Wilmington? Like we service, like for shredding, but not for Shred events, it looks like. Gotcha. You guys just do like ongoing Shredding service. Like one-time pickups. One-time pickups. We dont leave bins. Gotcha. We dont leave boxes or bags. We only leave the little boxes or boxes you had at that time to Shred. Oh, okay. Well, can you tell me about the one-time pickup? For how many boxes? Well, without being able to estimate that, do you guys have like, you know, if you are picking up X amount, it costs this much. If youre picking up this amount, it costs this much. Do you have a standard like that? Is this for a business or a residence? Its for a business. I only have pricing for up to nine boxes. it would be a flat rate of $155 to have the mobile truck come out gotcha alrighty well thank you for the information of course bye"
